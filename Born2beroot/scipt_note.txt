#CPU: central processing unit, the brain of the computer, core is the mini-brain of the CPU
#physical CPU: the actual, physical chip
#virtual CPU: used in virtual machines, a share of time on physical or logical core
#CORE: imagine a CPU is a kitchen, and each core is a cook;(an independent processing unit inside a CPU), each core can run one thread independently
#physical core: a real, physical core inside the CPU; A CPU  with 6 cores = 6 physical cores
#logical core: one physical core -> two logical cores(thanks to hyper-threading); Each physical core can sometimes run 2 threads at the same time.
,allows each physical core to handle multiple threads.

#Architecture: the type of CPU your computer uses, specifically, the instruction set that the CPU understands.
it determines how software interacts with hardware.
#uname stands for Unix Name, it's a command used to get system information.
#sort: sorts lines if text; -u unique, it removes duplicate lines after sorting
#Kernel version: think of the kernel as the bridge between application and hardware
#physical id: physical id entries tell you which CPU each core belongs to.
#processor: Each line starting with processor represents a virtual processor (logical core).

#RAM:  RAM is your computer's short-term memory where active data and programs are stored for quick access by the CPU
#free: displays system memory usage 
#--mega: Shows output in megabytes (MB) 
#awk: A text-processing tool that extracts and manipulates data; basic syntex:awk 'pattern{action}'
#{print $2}: if the condition ($1 == "Mem:") is true, awk executes the action inside { }.print $2 outputs the second column of that line.

#Disk: refers to permanent storage (HDD, SSD, etc.) where data is stored even after power-off.
#df: disk filesystem, display information about the amount of disk space used and available on filesystems.
#grep : search for pattern in text:"/dev/":Filters lines containing /dev/
#grep -v(invert): show line do not match 
#disk_t/1024: Converts MB to GB (since 1024 MB = 1 GB)

#vmstat:displays real-time system performance statistics related to:CPU,Memory,Processes,I/O,Swap usage
#vmstat basic syntax: vmstat interval count
#why interval: The values are averages since the last system boot â€” not helpful for diagnosing short-term issues.
#Uses "expr" for arithmetic (old-school but portable)
#cpul (idle):Percentage of time the CPU is not working

#who:The who command in Linux/Unix is used to show who is currently logged in to the system and some related session information.
#-b: Shows the last boot time of the system

#lvm:LVM stands for Logical Volume Manager. It is a flexible and powerful system for managing disk storage in Linux.
#it can abstract physical disks so you can create, resize, and manage storage more easily and flexibly than with traditional partitions.
#grep -q:  Searches quietly (no output) for the string "lvm"; if the search succeeds (exit status 0), echo "yes" runs.

#ss: socket statistics; socket can sending and receiving data across a network; it allows communication between computers
#-ta: t for tcp sockets; a for show all sockets
#ESTAB: it refers to the state of a TCP connection; The connection between two devices has been successfully opened and is now actively exchanging data.
#TCP:A TCP connection is a reliable and structured way for two devices to communicate over a network. It ensures that data arrives completely, accurately, and in order

#IPv4: IPv4 address meaning the computer's unique numerical identifier
#-I : ip address

#link/ether: This refers to the Ethernet link type, which is the most common type of network interface on modern systems (e.g., wired and wireless network interfaces).
#link refers to the link layer in the OSI model, where physical device information (such as MAC addresses) is stored.
#MAC: media access control ;ether is the Ethernet protocol used for most wired connections, which uses MAC addresses to identify devices on the local network.

#journalctl:  a command that queries the systemd journal logs.
#_COMN: a field in the systemd journal logs. It refers to the name of the command that generated the log entry.
