#What is VM?
It's like running a computer inside your computer;  It runs an operating system and applications 
just like a real computer, but it's hosted on another physical machine, called the host.

#What is the purpose of virtual machines?
The purpose of virtual machines (VMs) is to simulate a physical computer in software, 
allowing multiple operating systems and applications to run on a single physical machine 
independently and securely. Each VM runs in its own environment, so crashes in one VM 
donâ€™t affect the host or other VMs.

#Differences between apt and aptitude
Aptitude is an enhanced version of apt. APT is a lower-level package manager and aptitude 
is a high-level package manager. Another big difference is the functionality offered by both tools. 
Aptitude offers better functionality compared to apt-get. Both are able to provide the necessary 
means to perform package management. However, if you are looking for a more feature-rich approach, Aptitude should be it.

conventional partitioning schemes for storing volumes.
