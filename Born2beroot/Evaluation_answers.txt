#What is VM?
It's like running a computer inside your computer;  It runs an operating system and applications 
just like a real computer, but it's hosted on another physical machine, called the host.

#What is the purpose of virtual machines?
The purpose of virtual machines (VMs) is to simulate a physical computer in software, 
allowing multiple operating systems and applications to run on a single physical machine 
independently and securely. Each VM runs in its own environment, so crashes in one VM 
donâ€™t affect the host or other VMs.

#Differences between apt and aptitude
Aptitude is an enhanced version of apt. APT is a lower-level package manager and aptitude 
is a high-level package manager. Another big difference is the functionality offered by both tools. 
Aptitude offers better functionality compared to apt-get. Both are able to provide the necessary 
means to perform package management. However, if you are looking for a more feature-rich approach, Aptitude should be it.

#What is LVM

#why Debian? Debian vs Rockey

#TTY?

#the purpose of sudo
This helps in increasing security by ensuring that only authorized users can perform administrative tasks without 
logging into the root account directly. By using sudo, you can perform administrative tasks without giving users full root access. 
This helps limit the damage in case a user makes a mistake or an attacker gains access to your account.

#why UFW
protect our system, A firewall helps block unwanted or malicious traffic,ensuring that only authorized users can access your system

#what is SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) is used to securely connect to remote computers and manage them over an unsecured network
It allows for secure access to remote systems, transfer of files, and execution of commands, all while keeping your data safe. 
SSH is a must-have for security and efficiency in the digital age.
