#CPU: central processing unit, the brain of the computer, core is the mini-brain of the CPU
#physical CPU: the actual, physical chip
#virtual CPU: used in virtual machines, a share of time on physical or logical core
#CORE: imagine a CPU is a kitchen, and each core is a cook;(an independent processing unit inside a CPU), each core can run one thread independently
#physical core: a real, physical core inside the CPU; A CPU  with 6 cores = 6 physical cores
#logical core: one physical core -> two logical cores(thanks to hyper-threading); Each physical core can sometimes run 2 threads at the same time.
,allows each physical core to handle multiple threads.

#Architecture: the type of CPU your computer uses, specifically, the instruction set that the CPU understands.
it determines how software interacts with hardware.
#uname stands for Unix Name, it's a command used to get system information.
#sort: sorts lines if text; -u unique, it removes duplicate lines after sorting
#Kernel version: think of the kernel as the bridge between application and hardware
#physical id: physical id entries tell you which CPU each core belongs to.
#processor: Each line starting with processor represents a virtual processor (logical core).

#RAM:
